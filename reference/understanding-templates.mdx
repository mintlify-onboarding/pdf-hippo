Templates are the dynamic PDF documents to which you can pass values using our APIs

## Creating Templates on PDF Hippo

You can currently create templates using two means:

* Cloning or making a copy of an existing sample template  
   * Sample templates are default excel files for various business use cases that helps you get started within seconds.  
   * You can save these samples, download them, map the variables you use and generate APIs.  
   * These samples are always available. You can only make clones of samples
* Uploading an Excel file  
   * You can upload an Excel file prepopulated with variable values. You can find more about making the excel ready to be uploaded [over here](/reference/mapping-data-to-your-templates)

## Template Statuses

Once you create a template, you can either make it live or make changes in the test mode.

* Test State  
   * Once you upload or save a sample as a new template the default state would be test unless you make it live.  
   * In the test state, the APIs would not be live
* Live State  
   * Once you are ready to start creating your PDFs at scale, you can make the template live  
   * This would give you the API to generate the PDF at scale

## Sample Templates

We currently have a pre-existing library of 15 default templates for various use cases (we're building a new sample template every other dayðŸŽ‰)
